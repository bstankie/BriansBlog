# Summary

I have had the good fortune of spending more than a decade in academia (graduate student, post doctorial and professor) in addition to more than a decade in industry at a fortune 100, multi-national corporation. I have often been asked by interns, graduate students, post docs, 'Why did you move from academia to industry?' followed closely by 'What is the difference between the academia vs. industry?' I decided to take some time and write down my thoughts on the topic. Below you will find my initial thoughts.

# TL;DR
Academia and industry both can provide fulfilling, challenging and valuable careers. When deciding on a career path between the two, there is 'no right answer', just different paths and the decision that you make does not need to be permanent (although switching between the two will take work). To make the best decision that you can, be honest with yourself in what you like to do and what you don't like to do. Sit down with yourself and ask 'If I could do X for 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, what would it be?' (my answer was 'Program algorithms') Just as important, answer the question 'If I never had to do Y again, I would be very happy (my answer was 'Write another research paper').' This will help you to understand where your passion is and is not, and align that with a career path that rewards those behaviors.

## Framing the question

Academia and industry both can provide very fulfilling careers. This decision  (like most life decisions) comes down to an **HONEST** assessment of one's set of values. Three important thing that I always try to make **VERY CLEAR** when talking about this topic are: 

1. *There is no 'right answer'...just different paths.* If you are asking this question you have been part of academia for almost your entire life with tests and research projects and you have been taught that there is a 'right answer' and you worked very hard to find those answers. In this case, there are just different answers that will take you on a different life path and on both paths you can find fulfillment, happiness and success.

2. *The decision is not permanent.* As I've experienced my career and watched other careers (and this is generally true of life), straight lines are drawn with crooked paths. Moving between academia and industry can be very difficult (both directions) but not impossible. 

3. *You didn't get here by making bad choices.* Whether you have a Ph.D. or you are considering getting a Ph.D., your accomplishments are built on a series of very good choices. Therefore, in this case all of the 'bad' options are  off of the table (e.g., 'post doc or become a crack addict?'). If you are having a difficult time deciding then have confidence that both choices are excellent choices but that they are just different (see item #1 'no right answer').

So with that said, both academia and industry can provide excellent opportunities for a fulfilling, challenging and rewarding career.

opportunities for teaching, research, working with smart and talented people, wealth and making a difference in the world. However, being able to do these things in academia or industry can either be 'natural' or 'forced'. When 'forced' that means it is possible, but you will have to bring your organization outside of their comfort zone to make it happen. When 'natural' it is the natural part of your career path. Below you can find a summary of forced vs. natural.

## Academic Research Summary

In a separate blog, I will summarize my academic journey so those of you who want to either know what that journey might look like, or would like to put these comments into context can read about my experiences.

### Academic Value System

Value systems are very important. It will tell you what will be rewarded and if your passion and/or skill strengths align with that value system you will be rewarded. I want to be clear that these conclusions are based upon my experiences and the experiences of others may lead to different conclusions. However, I will say that I have talked to a lot of people who are in academia and industry and for the most part these views are shared.

#### Teaching vs. Research

My journey led me through a number of high-powered research institutions and as such there is an emphasis on research. Teaching in these institutions are neither a focus nor is it truly valued. I was told explicitly when I was a professor that as long as you are getting '3s' on your teaching ratings, you'll be fine and if you your teaching is not the greatest, do not worry about it. Personally, I enjoyed teaching, but I fully recognized the value system that I was in at the University. So, I would always tell my students "I will make all of my notes available on-line. You will have all of the readings. If you don't find any value in my teaching, don't come. I will be paid the same either way." I also would tell them, "You are attending a high-power research institution. If you are only going to classes and not taking advantage of working in a research lab or with a professor you are not getting the full value out of your education."

If your passion is teaching, go to a teaching college. I have some good friends at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/) who came from high power research universities and decided to focus on teaching. They are extremely happy with that decision. If you decide to go to a high-power research institution, your path to success will be through research papers and grants.

#### Research in Academia

Research in academia is great. There are an infinite number of questions that you can ask and sometimes it seems that professors are doing just that...asking an infinite number of arbitrary questions (IMHO). However, my experience was that when I finally made it to be a professor, I actually spent less time doing research than I did as a graduate student or a postdoc. 

When I was a professor I spent my time in the following way.

* 30% Teaching and teaching prep (~4 courses a year; 1 graduate, 1 upper-level undergrad and 1 lower-level course).  Even when I had my lectures and materials completed, I still had to spend time in the classroom, meeting with teaching assistants (TAs), students, preparing exams, etc.

* 20% mentoring undergraduate/graduate students (I enjoyed this part of my job. I did more than I was encouraged to do.)

* 20% writing research grants (I was an assistant professor looking to get funding for my lab).

* 10% writing research papers (I did not enjoy this part of my job so I didn't spend as much time doing it).

* 5% department and university 'church work' (meetings, admissions, teaching reviews, etc.)

* 5% Research: coding, designing experiments, reading research papers

When you become a professor at a research institution you don't spend your time doing what got you there (research) but end up spending most of your time managing and building your lab. In my experience it is much like creating a startup in the safety of a company where your paycheck is guaranteed.

##### Punch the Biggest Inmate in the Yard


One of the challenges that I see is being able to evaluate the value of answering a research question. It is interesting that when going into science we have an implicit understanding that answering some questions has more value than answering

2. How self-directed am I?
2. How much money is 'enough'?
3. How much do I value having a tangible impact on the world?
4. How much do I value helping others?
